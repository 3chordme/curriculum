This is a _very_ quick crash course in some of the things I have learned from [__DevMountain__](www.devmountain.com "DevMountain's Homepage").

### 01. Intro to Terminal and HTML
In this lesson, we will organize our dock, learn some basic Terminal commands, and make our very first website using simple HTML.

###### 01.01 - Organizing the Dock

Clean up your dock! Remove all items that you don't use regularly, and add Terminal and Chrome to the Dock so that you can easily access them. They will soon be two of your best friends.


###### 01.02 - Terminal Navigation

We are going to use the following commands to make a directory (aka folder) named helloWorld. Inside of that folder, we are going to create a file called index.html.

`pwd` print working directory.

`ls` list sorted. `l` list unsorted.

`cd dir_name` change directory. `cd` go up one directory.

`mkdir dir_name` make directory.

`touch file_name` create file.

`nano file_name` edit file in nano.

`open file_name` open file using default program.
